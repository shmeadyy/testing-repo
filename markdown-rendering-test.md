<summary> How do you decide which events to support?</summary></br>

Hubbers come in all stripes and speak to all manner of audiences. In addition to our messaging and audience priorities, we're working to build out a more central place for matching open CFPs to just the right subject matter expert. Our goal is to help you land content organically as well as consider the financial responsibility that might be involved with sending Hubbers to in-person conferences.

We ask a number of key questions:

- Does the event help open source maintainers manage their projects and organizations better?
- Are we able to reach a significant developer population in the target audience?
- Are you giving a talk or workshop that furthers a GitHub strategic feature or initiative?
- Do we have the people and resources to execute an event engagement to GitHub's standards?
